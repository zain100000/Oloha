A React.js frontend application built with Vite, Bootstrap 5, and Redux Toolkit for managing the EventSphere platform as a Super Administrator. The Super Admin module allows administrators to manage and update user accounts, receive notifications about current and upcoming events held within or outside the city—including concerts, seminars, live shows, theater, and cultural programs—and perform complete event management tasks such as creating, editing, and deleting events. It also enables configuring registration processes, ticket sales, and pricing structures, as well as uploading and managing event-related content like images, schedules, and other materials.
